# HugoVSCode

A Hugo theme made with inspiration from VSCode.

## Try it out

Add the repository into your Hugo Project repository as a submodule.

```git
git submodule add https://github.com/JohnRoos/HugoVSCode.git themes/HugoVSCode
```

## No JavaScript, only CSS

This template does not use any JavaScript at all (the only exception is Google Analytics). Everything is made with pure HTML and CSS.

## Live Demo

I am running this on my blog which you can find here: https://blog.roostech.se

## Far from completed

This theme still have a lot of bugs which need to be sorted out. I will continue improving it over time. Feel free to report issues if you find any.
