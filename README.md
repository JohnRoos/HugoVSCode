# HugoVSCode

A Hugo theme made with inspiration from VSCode.

## Try it out

Add the repository into your Hugo Project repository as a submodule.

```git
git submodule add https://github.com/JohnRoos/HugoVSCode.git themes/HugoVSCode
```

## No JavaScript, only CSS

This template does not use any JavaScript at all. Everything is made with pure HTML and CSS.

As an option you can enable Google Analytics and Disqus. In that case there will be a small amount of JavaScript which I cannot avoid.

## Live Demo

I am running this on my blog which you can find here: https://blog.roostech.se

## Far from completed

This theme still have a lot of bugs which need to be sorted out. I will continue improving it over time. Feel free to report issues if you find any.
